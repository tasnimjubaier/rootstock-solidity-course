# Code Example - Initial

In this folder you will find code for a project that is
incomplete, missing features, containing bugs,
or a combination of the above.

## Task

Your task is to look in the accompanying folder
that contains a complete version of the same code,
and observe the changes.

- `01-install.sh` <!-- showDiff -->
  - Install a solidity compiler using `npm`
    - With a specific version: `0.8.13`
  - Print out the full version number of the solidity compiler
- `02-compile.sh` <!-- showDiff -->
  - Run the solidity compiler against the provided Solidity source code, `02-example.sol`, such that it only outputs the ABI
  - Runs the solidity compiler against the provided Solidity source code, `02-example.sol`, such that it only outputs the bytecode
  - Runs the solidity compiler against the provided Solidity source code, `02-example.sol`, such that it outputs both the ABI and the bytecode
- `03-warnings.sol` <!-- showDiff -->
  - Run the solidity compiler against this file, and observe the warnings that have been output
  - Modify this solidity file such that when you run the Solidity compiler, the warnings are resolved
- Bonus
  - Compile one (or more) of the solidity files in the `solidity-syntax` folder
  - Note that there are no files to view for this
